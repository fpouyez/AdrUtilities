# Using TypeScript for Frontend Development

## Context and Problem Statement

Our current web application uses vanilla JavaScript for frontend development. As the project grows and new features are added, we are facing issues with maintainability, debugging, and collaboration between developers. Type errors are frequent and are only detected at runtime.

## Decision Drivers

* **Maintainability**: Need to improve frontend code maintainability
* **Type Safety**: Reduce runtime type errors
* **Developer Productivity**: Enhance development experience with autocompletion
* **Collaboration**: Facilitate collaboration between developers
* **Scalability**: Support project growth

## Considered Options

* **Vanilla JavaScript** - Continue with JavaScript without changes
* **TypeScript** - Migrate to TypeScript with strict configuration
* **Flow** - Use Flow for static typing
* **Babel with type plugins** - Use Babel with type validation plugins

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "TypeScript", because it offers the best balance between type safety, mature ecosystem, excellent IDE integration, and wide industry adoption.

### Consequences

* Good, because significant reduction of runtime type errors
* Good, because improved autocompletion and code navigation
* Good, because better code documentation with types
* Bad, because learning curve for the team
* Bad, because additional compilation time
* Neutral, because progressive migration is possible

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Vanilla JavaScript

* Good, because no migration needed
* Good, because no compilation time
* Bad, because type errors detected only at runtime
* Bad, because no advanced autocompletion
* Bad, because manual type documentation

### TypeScript

* Good, because type errors detected at compile time
* Good, because excellent IDE support with autocompletion
* Good, because mature and well-supported ecosystem
* Good, because progressive migration is possible
* Bad, because additional compilation time
* Bad, because initial learning curve

### Flow

* Good, because type error detection
* Good, because integration with JavaScript ecosystem
* Bad, because less mature ecosystem than TypeScript
* Bad, because less advanced IDE support
* Bad, because declining adoption

### Babel with type plugins

* Good, because integration with Babel ecosystem
* Bad, because limited typing features
* Bad, because insufficient IDE support
* Bad, because less mature ecosystem
